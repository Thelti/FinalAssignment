	<div id ="imagedesc">
		<p>The <strong>Adeptus Mechanicus</strong> is the official Imperial name within the Adeptus Terra
		for the Cult Mechanicus or Cult of the Machine based on Mars which provides the
		Imperium with its scientists, engineers and technicians. The Adepts of the Mechanicus
		are the primary keepers of what is viewed as sacred wisdom, a privileged caste of
		Tech-priests who jealously guard the knowledge required to maintain and construct
		much of the Imperium's advanced technology.

		<p>The <strong>Orks</strong>, also called Greenskins, are a savage, warlike, green-skinned race of humanoids
			who are spread all across the Milky Way Galaxy. They share many features with Warhammer Fantasy Orcs
			(and were initially called "Space Orcs" to distinguish them). They are seen by their enemies
			(pretty much everyone else in the universe) as savage, warlike, and crude, but they are the most
			successful species in the whole galaxy, outnumbering possibly every other intelligent race, even Mankind
			(with the very plausible exception of the Tyranids).</p>
	</div>
	<div id ="imagedesc3">
		<p>The <strong>Imperium of Man</strong> is a galaxy-spanning interstellar human empire, the ultimate
			authority for the majority of the human race in the Milky Way Galaxy in the late
			41st Millennium A.D. It is ruled by the living god who is known as the Emperor of Mankind.
			However, there are other humanoid species classified as Imperial citizens, mainly mutant
			offshoots of genetic base-line humans who are known as Abhumans and include such human sub-races
			as the Ogryns, Ratlings and Squats.</p>
