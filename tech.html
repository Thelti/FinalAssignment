<div class="Description">
	<div id ="imagedesc">
		<p>The Mark IV Arkhan Galvanic Rifle, modelled after the hunting flintlocks of Mars'
			distant colonial past, is a precision tool in the hands of a Skitarii Ranger.
			Its bodywork is that of an antique, with a polished wooden stock and curlicues
			that echo the sandy seas of Mars' desert. Yet the galvanic Servitor-bullets inside
			are incredibly advanced. When such a bullet strikes home, it causes all the potential
			 energy of the target to burn out in a killing blast of electric force. </p>
	</div>
	<div id ="imagedesc2">
		<p>A Shoota is a kinetic, automatic ballistic weapon used by the Orks that is
			chosen not for its efficiency but for the amount of noise it makes and the
			amount of damage it can do. The best Shootas are deafening and deadly in equal measure.
			There is no standard design for a Shoota, as most are hand-crafted by Mekboyz and "kustomized"
			by their owners, so although they may conform to a general pattern, no two Shootas will look the same.
			A Shoota fires either massive, large calibre bullets or explosive shells, or even a mixture of both.</p>
	</div>
	<div id ="imagedesc3">
		<p>The Lasgun, also sometimes referred to as a Lasrifle, is a directed-energy antipersonnel
			weapon used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man, and it is the most common and
			widely-used type of laser weapon in the galaxy. It is standard-issue for the Adeptus Mechanicus'
			cybernetic Skitarii infantry, all Astra Militarum rank-and-file infantry and most junior
			Astra Militarum officers. Lasguns are reliable, easy to maintain and to produce,
			and are readily available on most Imperial worlds. </p>
